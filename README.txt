INTRODUCTION
------------
Learning about and competing in FBLA competitions can be very challenging. Often times, the 
methods of learning about FBLA are simply not immersive enough and tend to lose the students' 
focus easily. This is the core reason why we created Quizio, an interactive way of both learning 
and testing ones knowledge. Quizio is an iOS application built specifically to fit a FBLA competitorâ€™s 
needs. Quizio provides students with study tools essential to ones success ranging from practice quizzes,
posts for user questions, personalized learning experience with flash cards, and other resources. Our 
simple and unique UI ensures users spend their quality time on Quizio gaining aid. Our motto is simple. 
Knowledge is power.


REQUIREMENTS
------------
  - In order to run Quizio it is recommended to use an iPhone 7, however it is cross platform and will 
run on any device lower than the iPhone X (ie:iPhone 8, iPhone6s, and iPhone 6).
  - Device running any iOS above 10.0

INSTALLATION
------------
 - Quizio is not available on the iOS App Store 
 - User must run application through the Xcode simulator or personal device


SOFTWARE USED
-------------
We used Xcode 10.1 during development of this iOS application. For the app's icon and a 
large majority of our user interface, we used Sketch to enhance our colors. Finally, we used 
Github to store our code online to ensure all members of our team would be able to collaborate on 
the most updated version of our code.


SOURCES
-------
Since all members of our team had prior experience with iOS development, we did not use many outside 
sources. Instead we referred to each other, youtube, or stack overflow for assistance. We also used 
Dribble to get a sense of what a quiz app would look like, and created every piece of our UI from Sketch.

Open-Source Frameworks
  - Custom Alert View (https://github.com/vikmeup/SCLAlertView-Swift)
  - Carousel View Layout (https://github.com/ink-spot/UPCarouselFlowLayout)

SDKs
  - Firebase iOS SDK (https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup)

Other Assets
  - Icons were provided from FlatIcon (https://www.flaticon.com)

User Interface
  - All of our user interface was developed in sketch and imported into Xcode for usage.



TEMPLATES
---------
No templates were used to develop Quizio.



INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING PROJECT
--------------------------------
To run Quizio on the Apple iOS Simulator:
Open the Xcode Project titled "FBLA". Once inside open the project labeled "FBLA.xcworkspace". 
Now click the run button at the top left corner next to green screen maximize button. 
When prompted for a device type, select iPhone 7 for best performance. Note: Quizio will run
on any device 6+ or higher, but the user interface will not be as glossy and may have cut corners.

To run Quizio on a physical iPhone (iPhone 7 recomended):
First download the Xcode file project "FBLA". When opened, find and open the Xcode file project 
titled "FBLA.xcworkspace". When opened, click the run button at the top left corner next to screen
maximize button. Again any iPhone lower than the X will run Quizio adequately. Again an iPhone 7 is recommended 
but not mandatory. When promoted to select a device scroll and select your device's name. Ensure to accept 
any prompts that may pop up when running. Additionally if asked to trust the developer, go to Settings and 
then General. Scroll down to device management and trust the developer to enable permission to run Quizio 
on the device.
